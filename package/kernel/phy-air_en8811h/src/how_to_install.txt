EN8811H PHY Linux Driver Install

1. Copy air_en8811h_main.c, air_en8811h_api.c, air_en8811h_api.h and air_en8811h.h to /drivers/net/phy/

2. Add below message to the Kconfig
	config AIROHA_EN8811H_PHY
		tristate "Drivers for Airoha EN8811H 2.5G Gigabit PHY"
		---help---
		  Currently supports the Airoha EN8811H PHY.

	config AIROHA_EN8811H_PHY_DEBUGFS
		bool "EN8811H debugfs support"
		depends on AIROHA_EN8811H_PHY
		---help---
		  Enable creation of debugfs files for the EN8811H drivers.

3. Add below message to the Makefile
	air_en8811h-y := air_en8811h_main.o air_en8811h_api.o
	obj-$(CONFIG_AIROHA_EN8811H_PHY)	+= air_en8811h.o

4. The following dts configuration is only for example. Please check your platform of DTS first.
    mdio: mdio-bus {
        #address-cells = <1>;
        #size-cells = <0>;
		...
		...
		
        phy5: phy@5 {
			compatible = "ethernet-phy-id03a2.a411";
			reg = <15>;
			phy-mode = "2500base-x";
			full-duplex;
			pause;
			airoha,polarity = <1>;
			airoha,surge = <0>;
			airoha,cko-en = <0>;
		};
	...
	...
	}

Note:
* SerDes polarity setting could be configured in dts. Please refer to the following description.
Tx Reverse, Rx Normal:
		airoha,polarity = <0>;
Tx Normal, Rx Normal:
		airoha,polarity = <1>;
Tx Reverse, Rx Reverse:
		airoha,polarity = <2>;
Tx Normal, Rx Reverse:
		airoha,polarity = <3>;

* Surge protection setting could be configured in dts. Please refer to the following description.
Surge protection - 0R
airoha,surge = <0>;
Surge protection - 5R
airoha,surge = <1>;

* Co-clock output setting could be configured in dts. Please refer to the following description.
Co-clock output - Disabled
airoha,cko-en = <0>;
Co-clock output - Enabled 
airoha,cko-en = <1>;
